# Password Strength Assessment Tool
This Python program evaluates the strength of a user-provided password based on several criteria, including length, use of lowercase and uppercase letters, digits, and special characters. It provides feedback on how to improve weak passwords and assigns a strength score out of 10.

Features
Password Strength Assessment: Scores the password from 0 to 10 based on length and the inclusion of various character types.
Detailed Feedback: Provides guidance on how to strengthen a password, such as adding more characters, digits, special symbols, etc.
Interactive Input: The user inputs a password and receives real-time assessment and feedback.
Requirements
Python 3.x
How It Works
Password Analysis:
The password is evaluated based on:
Length (8+ characters for basic strength, 12+ for extra strength)
Use of lowercase and uppercase letters
Inclusion of digits and special characters (@, $, !, %, *, ?, &, #)
Scoring:
The score is calculated as follows:
Password length of at least 8 characters: +2 points
Password length of at least 12 characters: +2 points
Use of lowercase letters: +2 points
Use of uppercase letters: +2 points
Inclusion of digits: +1 point
Inclusion of special characters: +2 points
The final score is capped at 10.
Feedback: After the score is determined, the tool provides specific advice on how to improve the password's strength.
Usage
Clone or download the project files.

Open a terminal or command line.

Run the script.

Enter your password when prompted.

The program will output a password strength score and provide suggestions to improve the password.

Example
bash
Copy code
Password Strength Assessment Tool
Enter your password: MyPassword123!

Password Strength: Strong (Score: 9/10)

Feedback:
- For extra security, consider using a password with 12 or more characters.
Code Structure
Password Strength Function: Calculates the strength score based on password characteristics.
Feedback Function: Gives detailed feedback on how the password can be improved.
Main Function: Combines the assessment and feedback functions and prints the final result.
Notes
The program currently uses a simple scoring mechanism and provides basic feedback. It can be enhanced to include more complex criteria for assessing password security.
Special characters considered in this version include: @, $, !, %, *, ?, &, #.
Future Improvements
Add more advanced password analysis such as entropy calculation.
Incorporate rules to detect common password patterns (e.g., dictionary words, sequences).
Provide a GUI for non-technical users.
